# Azure Kinect DK notes

Developer kit with AI sensors (depth sensor, spatial microphone array with a video camera, and orientation sensor)

SDKs:
- Sensor SDK for low-level sensor and device access.
- Body Tracking SDK for tracking bodies in 3D.
- Speech Cognitive Services SDK for enabling microphone access and Azure cloud-based speech services.

For our purposes we only need the Sensor SDK.

# Installing and configuring the sensor SDK
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/kinect-dk/sensor-sdk-download

## Linux
- configure Microsoft's Package Repository
18.04
```
curl https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc | sudo apt-key add -
 sudo apt-add-repository https://packages.microsoft.com/ubuntu/18.04/prod
 sudo apt-get update
```

- Install k4a-tools
Includes the Azure Kinect Viewer, the Azure Kinect Recorder, and the Azure Kinect Firmware Tool
```
sudo apt install k4a-tools
sudo apt install libk4a1.1-dev
```

The SDK is now ready to use! You can test it by recording for 5 seconds. By default, the recorder uses the NFOV Unbinned depth mode and outputs 1080p RGB at 30 fps including IMU data.

```
sudo k4arecorder -l 5 output.mkv
```
or just use the GUI to view and record (better to see if the camera is properly configured)
```
sudo k4aviewer
```

## Troubleshooting ubuntu problems
```
lsmod |grep xhc
```
Try reading the messages in
```
dmesg
```

So for some reason 
[ 3650.378811] uvcvideo: Failed to set UVC probe control : -32 (exp. 26).
and
[ 3650.728393] uvcvideo 8-1.2:1.0: Entity type for entity Extension 2 was not initialized!
[ 3650.728401] uvcvideo 8-1.2:1.0: Entity type for entity Extension 6 was not initialized!

[ 3650.728410] uvcvideo 8-1.2:1.0: Entity type for entity Camera 1 was not initialized!

### Things to try

You can try to removing and adding the kernel module
```
sudo rmmod uvcvideo
sudo modprobe uvcvideo
unplug camera from USB port
plug camera back in
```

Install uvcdynctrl package which installs suitable udev rules to initialize the missing controls from userspace.
```
sudo apt install uvcdynctrl v4l-utils
```

Camera doesn't work on USB3.0

Only the microphone works

Current status: Error: OpenGL 4.4 context creation failed. You could try updating your graphics drivers.
find graphics card
```
lspci | grep VGA
```

Check openGL version
```
sudo apt-get install mesa-utils
glxinfo | grep "OpenGL version"
glxinfo | grep "version"
```

The depth engine doesn't work. Turning off the depth camera makes everything work. The depth engine is not included in the SDK and can be installed using https://github.com/microsoft/Azure-Kinect-Sensor-SDK/blob/develop/docs/depthengine.md

OpenGL 3.1 on laptop

Depth engine is included in libk4a1.1-dev but is failed at initialization because of the OpenGL 4.4 error. This is what we need to fix.
Can we fix this
## Remove oibaf drivers and see if the default ones support opengl 4.4
```
sudo apt install ppa-purge
sudo ppa-purge ppa:oibaf/graphics-drivers
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade
```
